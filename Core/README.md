# Core Concepts

**
1. Core OS
2. Core Services
3. Cocoa Touch **

## Topics Covered 

**ðŸ”¹ 1. Core OS Layerâ€¨**

Foundation of iOS â€“ low-level system services & security.â€¨
* Kernel & Drivers
    * Darwin OS (Mach + BSD + I/O Kit)
    * Manages memory, CPU, processes, and hardware communication
* Security Frameworks
    * Secure Enclave â€“ Manages biometric and encryption data
    * Keychain Services â€“ Securely stores passwords, keys, etc.
* File System
    * APFS â€“ Optimized for SSD, supports encryption & snapshots
* Concurrency & Power
    * Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) â€“ Efficient task execution (queues, groups, semaphores)
    * Power & Memory Management â€“ Optimizes battery and resource use
* System Communication
    * XPC â€“ Lightweight interprocess communication (IPC)
    * System Configuration â€“ Access and manage network settings

**ðŸ”¹ 2. Core Services Layerâ€¨**

Provides essential services like data storage, networking, location, and motion.â€¨
ðŸ›  Key Functional Areas:
* Data Management
    * Core Data â€“ Object graph, persistence, undo/redo, change tracking
    * SQLite â€“ Lightweight embedded database
* Networking
    * CFNetwork â€“ Low-level networking (sockets, DNS, FTP, HTTPS)
    * URLSession â€“ High-level HTTP networking
* Location & Motion
    * Core Location â€“ GPS, geofencing, beacon detection, heading
    * Core Motion â€“ Access to accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer
* Web Integration
    * WebKit â€“ Render web content using WKWebView, JavaScript execution
* Core Foundation
    * Low-level C-based utilities: strings, dates, run loops (base for Foundation)

**ðŸ”¹ 3. Cocoa Touch Layerâ€¨**

High-level frameworks for UI, interaction, multimedia, and app experience.â€¨
ðŸŽ¨ UI & User Interaction:
* UIKit â€“ Main UI framework: views, buttons, animations, touch handling
* Foundation â€“ Shared layer with Core Services for data, dates, localization
ðŸŽ® Multimedia & Advanced Features:
* Core Motion â€“ Motion data from sensors
* AVFoundation â€“ Audio/video recording and playback
* GameKit â€“ Leaderboards, multiplayer, achievements
* MapKit â€“ Embed Apple Maps and location data
* MessageUI â€“ In-app email and messaging
* EventKit â€“ Calendar events and reminders
